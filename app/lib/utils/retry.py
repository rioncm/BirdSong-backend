    Execute the callable with exponential backoff and jitter.

        operation: Callable to execute.
        attempts: Maximum number of attempts.
        base_delay: Initial delay between attempts (seconds).
        max_delay: Maximum delay between retries (seconds).
        exceptions: Exception types that should trigger retry logic.
        logger: Optional logger for structured logging.
        description: Human-readable description for logging.
        jitter: Fractional jitter to apply to each delay (0.2 => Â±20%).
        is_retryable: Optional predicate to determine whether a caught exception
            should trigger a retry. Defaults to checking an attribute named
